### Script organization:

I am typing words here!
`0_download_data.ipynb`: Jupiter notebook that helps pull data from Synapse and upload onto the Cancer Genomics Cloud.

### Data preprocessing:

We are using scanpy to read the raw data file and concatenate scRNAseq data from multiple patients from the same cohort (WUSTL or HTAPP).
